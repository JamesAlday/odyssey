# Anti-Conga Flanking

A creature can’t flank an enemy that it can’t see. A creature also can’t flank while it is incapacitated. A Large or larger creature is flanking as long as at least one square or hex of its space qualifies for flanking.

When a creature and at least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite sides or corners of the enemy’s space, they flank that enemy, and each of them has advantage on melee attack rolls against that enemy.

When in doubt about whether two creatures flank an enemy on a grid, trace an imaginary line between the centers of the creatures’ spaces. If the line passes through opposite sides or corners of the enemy’s space, the enemy is flanked.

No Conga Lines. A creature cannot gain advantage for flanking if the creature is itself flanked by an enemy. 


# Inspiration Aspects

Players choose an aspect for their character, either Comedy (20) or Tragedy (1). Whenever the player rolls the number associated with that aspect on any d20 roll, the character gains Inspiration if it did not already have it.
