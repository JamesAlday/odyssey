With its monstrous size and many fearsome tusks, there is no mistaking the great boar for an earthly crea- ture. Great boar hunts are often organized to procure a grand sacrifice to the gods, though sometimes they are undertaken for the fame of slaying such a hugely fearsome creature. The great boar is dangerous for its amazing strength and deadly tusks, and because it brings madness to its foes. All but the most disciplined parties fall prey to this madness, and many hunters have died at the hands of their fellows.
